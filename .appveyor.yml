# This setup tests ICF-related software and workflows. There are two elements
# that have to be kept aligned with ICF's environment:
#
# 1. The input data structure should match the data that ICF receives from
#    acquisition sides.
#
# 2. The software environment should match the environment on ICF's machines,
#    i.e. the versions of: `git`, `git-annex`, `python`, `datalad`, and
#    `datalad-next`.
