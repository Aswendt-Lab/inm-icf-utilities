==========

Retrieval of imaging data in DICOM format is possible within the FZJ
internal network. Any access is authenticated, and requires
credentials provided by the ICF. Access permissions are granted on a
per-study level (i.e. an individual researcher can only access studies
for which they were granted permission).
Please contact `ICF personnel`_ to get access and for any authentication-related question.
